React User Data Display Assignment

#Objective

Create a React application that fetches user data from the Random User API and displays it in two different UI variations.

#Requirements
Create React App: Use create-react-app to bootstrap your React project.
Fetch User Data: Utilize the Random User API (specifically, the URL https://randomuser.me/api/?page=1&results=1&seed=abc) to fetch user data.

#UI Variation 1:
Display the user data in a card format.
The card should include the user's profile picture, first name, last name, gender, and mobile number.
Ensure the card design is visually appealing using CSS, with proper styling and layout.

#UI Variation 2:
Display the user's profile picture initially.
Upon clicking on the profile picture, expand the card to display additional details, including the user's full name, gender, and mobile number.
The expanded card should have a different layout from the initial card and should be visually distinct.

#Use Tailwind CSS: 

Employ Tailwind CSS for styling the UI components if possible, ensuring a clean and responsive design.

Correct usage of the Random User API to fetch user data.
Effective styling and layout using Tailwind CSS or appropriate CSS techniques.
